# Why you might not want to use this.
* everything is changing
* code quality is dubious
* scripts will be put to good use, but this is mostly for trials and more error
* no error handling

# Why you may want to look at this.
* You want to contribute to the new front-end

## TODOs, front-end design and possible future features
* save state per course/assignment
* keep configs ini based
* one front-end command (mdt), several subcommands:
  * sync
  * browse
  * grade
  * upload submission
* maybe utilize git
* even more automation
* faster grading ideas:
  * access previous feedback
  * regrade assignments
