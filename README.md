## Development

Before starting to develop on manly-man moodle scripts you should run the `boostrap` script.
This will setup `git-flow` with the default settings.

We recommend [`git-flow AVH Edition`](https://github.com/petervanderdoes/gitflow/).
For detailed installation instructions have a look at [https://github.com/petervanderdoes/gitflow/wiki](https://github.com/petervanderdoes/gitflow/wiki)

### Working with git-flow

1. Start a new feature with `git-flow feature start FEATURE_NAME` (this creates a new branch)
2. Hack on your feature
3. Finish your feature with `git-flow feature stop FEATURE_NAME` (this merges the branch into `develop`)
